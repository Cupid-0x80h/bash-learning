# bash-learning
some program I wrote while learning bash


# to run the scripts 
step 1: download them <br>
step 2: add executable permissions (chmod 777 bash.sh) <br>
setp 3: ./bash.sh <br>


(note that replace bash.sh with the script name)<br>

Here is the resource from where I am learning : https://linuxhandbook.com/bash/
